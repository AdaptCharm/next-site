import Layout from '~/components/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Export into a Static HTML App',
  courseId: 'excel',
  lessonId: 'static-html-export',
  stepId: 'setup'
}

In this lesson, we need a simple Next.js app to play with. Try to download the example app below.
(This is the blog app we created in previous lessons.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arunoda/learnnextjs-demo.git
cd learnnextjs-demo
git checkout static-blog-base
```

You can run it with:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
