## Deploying to ▲ZEIT Now

Now we know how to build and start a Next.js app. We did everything with npm scripts. So, you will be able to customize it to work with your favorite deployment service.

Using [▲ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now), add the following scripts to the package.json file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start -p 8000"
}
```

Then, create a now.json file in the root of your project with the following contents:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/next" }]
}
```

Finally, [install Now](https://zeit.co/now) and run the following command:

```
now
```

> Basically, you run the “now” command from your terminal inside your app's root directory.

Here, we mentioned port 8000 as the port in which we start our app. But we didn't change it when deploying to ZEIT Now.

So, in which port could we access our app when deployed to ZEIT Now?
