Next.js is great for building **content-oriented websites** such as blogs or marketing/sales websites.

When building content-oriented websites using Next.js, you need to decide _where you store the content_. The two choices are:

- Store content directly within your Next.js repository **as code** using react components or markdown files. This is great if everyone who edits the content is comfortable editing the code. Personal blogs/websites and open source project documentation are good examples of this.
- Store content externally in a **content management system (CMS)** and fetch it using API. This decouples your app and content, allowing editors to modify the content without touching the code. Company blogs and marketing websites are a good example of this.
