Using Next.js and third party services, you can create production-ready web apps. For example, you can use Next.js with [a headless CMS service](/examples/blog-headless-cms/introduction) to power your company blog or marketing website.

Both our core team and the community have created high quality Next.js examples covering different domains, and we’ve compiled them here. Each example can easily be deployed to [Vercel](http://vercel.com/), the deployment platform built by the creators of Next.js.

Your contributions are welcome! If you’re interested, please take a look at [our contributing guidelines](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md#adding-examples).
